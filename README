DOUBLE EXPONENTIAL
==================

The surge or pulse of activity can be characterized by the time it takes to reach
its peak, the height of the peak, the 1/2 life of the surge in activity, etc. To
compare stories or media souces, it is useful to fit the data to a standard pulse function in 
order to compare attributes consistently.

One convenient model is that the traffic follows a double exponential function.

Example: See the graph at http://blog.gnip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/pubfits.png (associated 
with the article at  http://blog.gnip.com/twitter-shouts-huntsmans-out/)

The fit.py utility fits the pulse in activity to a double exponential model of the pulse:

    A(t) = A0 * (1 -exp(-alpha * (t-t0))) * exp(-beta * (t-t0))

t - time
t0 - start of pulse
A0, alpha, beta are parameters describing magnitude, growth and decay.

fit.py requires the scipy module.

Try to window the data to the pulse before fitting.

Usage:

Example 1:

To fit the function, send data to standard input (fit.py).

This will calculate the best fit for A0 (shown as A below), alpha, beta, the starting time
of the pulse (t0 = tOffset), the time at the peak, the value at the peak, the average (first
moment) of the the pulse and the function value at tavg, the area under the curve (Norm)
and the 1/2 life-with the associated function value at t1/2.

If you don't specify any arguments, fit.py assumes your data consists of 2 columns (text headers ok)
and PulseFunc.py tries to guess initial parameters for the fit.

For instance, using the example file provided,

> cat data.csv | ./fit.py 

#  A=30056.640395
#  alpha=706.789547
#  beta=30.533273
#  tOffset=0.000099
#  TPeak=0.004604,    FPeak=25109.169342
#  TAvgT=0.034206,    FAvg=10608.680897
#  Norm=943.625186
#  T1/2life=0.028691, F1/2Life=12554.584671

NOTE: PulseFunc.py now outputs an additional time column at position 3 based on the t0 = 0.
This is useful for giving pulses a common baseline for comparing half-lives, peaks, etc
on a graph.

In addition to the fit parameters, the output also provides the function evaluated at the 
input data (time) points (first 2 columns) along side the original data (remaining columns).  
This makes it simple to calculate error or visualize the pulse against the data.

Example 2:

To specify initial values of fit parameters, use,

	fit.py -p"[A, alpha, beta, offset]"

Example 3:

To specify an alternate column for fit data, use -c (counting starts at 0). For example, if time is in
column 1 and your data is in column 4: 

	fit.py -c3

Example 4:

To specify a custom function evaluation range, use -r.

	fit.py -r[0,10,100]

Outputs an outer join of the data and the fit function evaluated at the points in the range specified, 
in this case 100 points spanning 0 to 10.
